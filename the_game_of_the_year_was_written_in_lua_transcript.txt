I want to get into game development where do I start if you ask Jonathan Blow a veteran of the industry you might get an optimistic answer my advice is if you are asking me that you're probably not cut out for making games sorry go away well here's another much colder take if you want to skip all the tutorials and engines and dependencies and headaches I think a great place to start is to do what local th creative batro did and use love 2D a super simple framework for riding 2D games in lure batro absolutely popped off this year it's many people's game of a year selling 2 million copies with an overwhelmingly positive rating on Steam and for good reason it's a really good game here's a quick summary if you haven't played it for some reason batro is a game about combos you play poker hands which each score points based on their chips and multiplier but you can purchase these powerups and Joker cards that all work together to increase your chips and multiply to Crazy amounts it's all about building the perfect hand if you don't get enough points you lose all your progress and have to start from scratch but runs are relatively short the game play makes for a fun and engaging experience with a lot of replayability but that's not my favorite part of this game my favorite part is how the cards go at the end of the hand how the score and multiple start to burn and shake when you're about to get a massive combo how the turn plays out by bouncing around the cards on the screen like a perfectly choreograph dance everything is so smooth and crisp this game looks and feels great which is why it's surprising that it's written in the same language that I used to configure my text editor Lua is a fantastic little language that's very easy to pick up and designed to be embedded for this reason it's mostly famous as a tool to mod games like Roblox and factorio and to configure software like neovim despite being small it is still fast and Powerful so while it is usually used as an auxiliary language it definitely has legs to stand on its own batro uses love 2D a framework for writing games in lower to create all those engaging animations and event Loops love 2D is really simple like really simple like so simple it would probably take you less time to read the whole documentation than to watch the average Unity tutorial it gives you exactly what you need to make a game and then lets you run wild I want to show you how easy it is to get started with love 2D by recreating something from batro let's recreate the animation at the end of the hand where all the cards are stacked back onto the deck a quick disclaimer there are ways to access the source code of Love 2D games it can be a great way to learn from other projects but don't ever copy or share code that you don't have a license to I made a very average looking card back in as Sur prite I can load the Sprite in the load function and draw it in the center of the screen in the draw function if a mouse is pressed I check if it's within the cards bounding box if it is then I set the cards position to to follow the mouse this animation is very rigid so let's add a Target position to the card when we move the mouse we update the target position instead of the actual position in the update function we call a function that moves the card using velocity instead of a fixed position the trajectory between the current and Target position only accounts for 25% of the movement the rest is the momentum from the current velocity this gives the animations That Bouncy feel where it overshoots and then snaps back into place let's create a day and ADD 52 cards to it the Align function takes all the cards in a deck and sets for Target position so that they stack up in a nice way if a card is not on top of the deck when the mouse is released it is removed from the deck now I can draw a circle underneath the deck and if the mouse is over that Circle when pressed I grab all the cards and add them back to the deck this is close but it needs some sounds to make it a little more satisfying I recorded myself flicking a plastic thing on the table and play it whenever a card moves this is starting to feel a bit more satisfying but it's still missing something a CT Shader immediately makes this feel more like batro I can take a CIT Shader I found online and load it into the game instead of drawing directly to the screen I draw everything to a canvas and then add the Shader to the canvas before drawing it to the screen shaders are batro is not so secret weapon the CRT effect the fire when you get a massive combo the card effects for Golden and foil cards the animations when a card is created or destroyed even the background is just a Shader local th is absolutely cooking with these he's really good at writing shaders and it gives the game so much personality shaders can be really rewarding to write but if you're not up for that challenge Shader toy is an excellent resource to find some shaders it's where I found the crt1 you may just need to tweak it a bit so that it plays nice with love 2D's implementation of the open G Shader language there's a foreign post detailing most of required changes in the description I don't mean to get distracted but there's also a complete Recreation of Super Mario Bros 1-1 created using only shaders on this website even the music is all in the Shader there's also this guy who made an entire Temple and he also has a 3-hour live coding session where he shows you exactly how we did it and it's awesome and he's also one of the creators of Shader toy anyway batro is awesome love 2D is awesome shaders are awesome awesome thank you for watching
